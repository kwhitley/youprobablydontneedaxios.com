## We need to talk.

### It won't be easy.

---

I know you've probably been wondering what's up; why we don't talk as much.  I know I've been saying I was busy with work, and that's true, but you point out that work used to bring us closer together.  That's also true.

But honestly, I feel like we've been growing apart for awhile.  I'm really trying to live a healthier, slimmer lifestyle - and you've been kind of encouraging unhealthy choices (although to be fair, my laziness is to blame too!).

My doctor says things need to change, and I agree.

> Things need to change. <cite>my doctor</cite>

So I guess it's time for us to part ways.

You're still fantastic, and there are many devs out there for you... it's totally me, not you... or something.
