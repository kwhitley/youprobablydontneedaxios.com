# welcome to <span class="accent">it<strike>t</strike>y</span>

This all started as a fun code-golfing experiment ([itty-router](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-router)), attempting to make a tiny, elegant micro-router for use in service workers, specifically the incredibly powerful/lightweight [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).  By 2022, this tiny router has become one of the mainstays of serverless routing within the Cloudflare Workers community.

This path has continued on to handle both API generation (including [response handling](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-router-extras) and [CORS](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-cors)) and API [consumption/interaction](https://npmjs.com/package/itty-fetcher).  Each library typically rests in the ~500 byte range, to keep both your code *and* your bundle sizes down.

## and... itty.industries?

In October 2022, itty industries, LLC. was formed to ensure the continuation of these open-source initiatives, as well as begin development on several free/commercial tools (to be announced shortly) under the "itty" brand.  Additionally, the free-to-use browser extension [Retheme](https://retheme.org) will be brought under the itty umbrella to continue support and development of that as well.
